Example:
int i = 5;
do {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    // Will not output 0 because the condition is checked after the loop body is executed
    // While loop will check the condition before executing the loop body
    // Same analogy as i-- vs --i
    i--;
} while (i != 0);
return 0;

expr1 is usually an initalizer before the loop is executed.
expr2 is the condition.
expr3 is usually an incrementer or modifier executed after each iteration of the loop body.

expr1 can be the initialization of multiple variables separated by commas.
expr3 can also be multiple expressions separated by commas.

Syntax:
for (expr1;expr2;expr3) {
    // loop body
}

Example 3:
for (int i = 1; i != 6; i++);
    printf("*");
return 0;

The above program prints one star because the ";" at the end of the for loop tells C to do nothing.

Example 4
for (int i = 1; i != 6; i++)
    printf("%d", i);
    printf("**");

The above program has a syntax error.

Example 5
for (int i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
    if (i % 2 == 0)
        i -= 2;
        printf("%d", i);
    
    return 0;
}

Be wary! The above program only outputs "8" because after one loop, the program ends.

Example 6
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0, j = 10; i <= 10, j < 50; ++i, j = i * i) {
        printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
    }
    return 0;
}

It is never appropriate to use comma to separate conditions. The comma operator always ignores the results of all of its operands with the exception of the very last one. There’s no meaningful way to specify a condition anywhere except for the very last position in the comma-separated sequence. So for our example only the condition j <50 is executed.
