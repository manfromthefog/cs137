Break & Continue Statements

Similar to switch statements, you can the break; comand to end a while, do or for statement early.
C also has a continue; statement that allows you to exit the loop body early and go to just before the end of the loop body.

!!! goto; is not allowed in CS137 !!!

Nested Loops

int i, j;
for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        printf("$");
    }
    printf("\n");
}
return 0;

Prints a total of 1+...+10 = 55 $ on a newline.

Example 1

int num, sum;
scanf("%d", &num);
for (sum = 0; num > 0; num = num / 10) {
    sum += num  % 10;
}
printf("%d", sum);

The scanf() Function

scanf() returns the number of items it properly had read successfully. Let's implement a number checking system.

int d = 0;
int sum = 0;

while(scanf("%d", &d) == 1) {
    sum += d;
}
printf("%d\n", sum);

The Prime Number Problem
1. Problem-Solving
2. Optimization
3. Best Programming Practices
4. Testing

Idea 1. Count all divisors of prime numbers, and the number of divisors is 2, we have a prime number.
Idea 2. Search for a single divisor, not 1 or n, and if we find one return false.
